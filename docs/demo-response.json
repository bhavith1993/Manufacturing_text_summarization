    "response":  "Label misalignment can cause delays and damage product quality. Follow these steps to ensure accurate labeling:\n\n- Ensure the label dispenser is aligned to the conveyor belt. Check that the dispenser is squared and securely positioned. \n\n- Verify label positioning on the product by sight. Adjust the label sensor to capture any misalignment and realign if needed. \n\n- Confirm label size and type. Cross-check with the product and packaging requirements. Ensure the correct labels are being used.\n\n- Check the label print for accuracy. Misspelled words or incorrect information require immediate attention and reprinting.\n\n- Maintain a steady conveyor speed. Excessive speed can cause labels to peel or shift. \n\n- Regularly inspect the glue gun and ensure it\u0027s functional. Replace or repair as necessary; poor glue quality can cause label issues.\n\n- Visually inspect each labeled product for accuracy. Products with incorrect or poorly placed labels must be relabeled or rejected.\n\n- Ensure operators are aware of any changes in product size or shape that might affect labeling. \n\n- Keep the packaging area clear and organized to avoid accidents or damage to products, which can impact label placement.\n\n- Periodically double-check your work. Maintain high standards, as label misalignment can reflect poorly on the company.\n\nSafety: \n- Operators must wear appropriate eyesight correction if needed.\n\nAcceptance criteria: \n- Labels must be straight, secure, and legible with no misspellings or errors. \n\nAn efficient process ensures accurate labeling and minimizes delays.",
